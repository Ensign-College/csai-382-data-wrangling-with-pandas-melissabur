The **Restaurant Orders** dataset simulates order transactions from a restaurant’s point-of-sale system. Each record represents an individual menu item purchased during a specific transaction, along with details about the date, category, and pricing.

The dataset is ideal for:
- Practicing **data cleaning and wrangling** using `pandas`
- Exploring **sales trends**, **menu performance**, and **customer behavior**
- Performing **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** operations and preparing data for visualization or analysis

### 🧠 A Note About Databricks and AI Usage
Databricks has a built-in AI assistant that can help you as you navigate and learn to work with data in this course.  
Remember, it’s important to **understand the results** so that AI becomes an **additional source of insight**, not just a shortcut for copy-pasting code.

As with all generative AI tools, it may produce **erroneous or incomplete results**.  
Part of your learning goal in CSAI 382 is to develop the skill to **evaluate and verify AI-generated output** with your own knowledge and reasoning.

#### 🕊 Guiding Principles
- Use AI tools **ethically** and **responsibly**, following the Church’s publication  
  [*Guiding Principles for the Church of Jesus Christ’s Use of Artificial Intelligence*](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/guiding-principles-for-use-of-artificial-intelligence).
- Strive for “**things as they really are**” (Jacob 4:13) by validating what you learn through both logic and inspiration.
- Let AI assist your learning, not replace your effort or understanding.
